# Foiling
Automatic foiling without any modules and with the power of Python!

## Limitations
There are a number of limitations to this project as of this time (v2.0.0-b1). Currently you can't foil with 3 or more numbers in a single pair of parentheses. In terms of algebra, you can't have a variable besides `x`. Another limitation is that you can't have a subscript with a value of 2 or higher on the `x`.

## Algebra support
This branch is where algebra is being attempted to be supported. The code here most likely won't work as intended.

# Challenge
This project was a challenge between a friend and I. His repo can be found [here](https://github.com/RedThunder1/FoilingProject)
